Opt for gentle, fragrance-free products that are pH-balanced to avoid irritating your skin further.\n\n3. **Take Shorter Baths or Showers**: Long, hot showers or baths can dry out the skin. Try to limit them to 5-10 minutes and use warm (not hot) water.\n\n4. **Apply Oatmeal or Aloe Vera Topically**: Both oatmeal and aloe vera have soothing properties that can help relieve dry, itchy skin. You can add colloidal oatmeal to your bath or apply pure aloe vera gel directly to the affected areas.\n\n5. **Stay Hydrated**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day to keep your body hydrated from the inside out.\n\n6. **Humidify Your Environment**: Dry air can exacerbate dry skin.
